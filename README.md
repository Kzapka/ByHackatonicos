<h1>What are we?

We are an app designed for citizens who live in risky areas and suffer from burns.

What is our goal?

Our goal is to control the areas to ensure the safety of the local population by preventing and fighting fires.

How do we do it?

We have an app that connects NGOs and the population with local authorities, in the app it will be possible to make reports of burnings, make posts and comment on them.
Partner NGOs warned of the risks and could report them.
The App will show real-time data on air humidity, fire hazards, high risk locations and satellite imagery for site location.

Incentive

We will have a loyalty program where people with the most reports and verified posts have been given a gift to encourage firefighting.
There will also be likes and comments in the reports.
We will also publicize partner NGOs and their work on firefighting.

Monetization

We will work with donations, partnerships with NGOs and governments, and sell cause-related things (T-shirts, bracelets, etc.).
